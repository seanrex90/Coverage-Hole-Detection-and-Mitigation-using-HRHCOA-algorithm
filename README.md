Operating a wireless sensor network with maximum coverage and maintaining prolonged network lifetime is a persistent challenge, 
where node failures, irregular deployment, and uneven energy consumption often lead to coverage holes, which reduce monitoring quality and network lifetime. 
To ensure maximum coverage and an energy-efficient network, this work aims to propose a hybrid raccoon-hermit crab optimization algorithm for cluster head-based sensor networks, 
ensuring optimal cluster head selection, efficient cluster formation, balanced energy use, effective coverage hole detection, and healing. 
The proposed multi-objective optimization technique enhances clustering quality by identifying coverage holes and efficiently healing them through the optimal deployment or repositioning of deployed nodes. 
Here, the Raccoon optimization algorithms exploration ability (global search) and Hermit Crab Optimization algorithms exploitation ability (local refinement or tuning) improve balanced energy utilization,
improved connectivity and adaptive recovery from coverage holes. 
The proposed technique is evaluated by extensive simulation and compared for the performance against traditional Low energy adaptive hierarchical clustering and its variants, 
Raccoon-inspired LEACH and Hermit crab-inspired LEACH, by using the performance metrics such as first node death, half node death, last node death, coverage ratio (before and after), 
throughput, delay and average energy consumption. 
This demonstrates that the proposed method outperforms the existing approaches with high stability and prolonged network lifetime and 
it provides a meta-heuristic-based clustering solution for overcoming coverage holes in critical or disaster-based monitoring applications.
